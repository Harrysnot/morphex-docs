**Morphex** is an emerging **decentralized exchange** offering **spot** and **perpetual futures** _trading_,
while requiring only a wallet connection to use.
All trades are settled against the **Morphex Liquidity Pool** (“MLP”),
where a user would be able to provide liquidity with any whitelisted asset, and in exchange,
they would receive **MLP tokens**, representing their share in the diversified liquidity pool.

For traders, **Morphex** offers various advantages over existing exchanges:

- [x] **low transaction fees**
- [x] **no price impact**
- [x] **“scam wick” liquidation protection** (while keeping full control of your assets)

Welcome to the new era of DeFi perpetual trading.

_Pricing_ for the protocol will be determined by an average of prices from **leading centralized exchanges** 
in conjunction with **Chainlink oracles**.
As the protocol matures, governance will eventually decide the majority of parameters
(examples include liquidity incentives for a specific **MLP pool** in the future).
