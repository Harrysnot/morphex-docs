**BMX** is a DeFi platform on Base and Mode offering **spot**, **margin**, and **NFT** trading,
requiring only a wallet connection to use. We offer 3 different products:

- **BMX Classic**: A spot and margin trading platform based on GMX-v1 with a focus on capital efficiency and low fees. All trades are settled against a singular liquidity pool consisting of blue-chip assets, where a user can provide liquidity with any whitelisted asset, and in exchange, they receive LP tokens, representing their share in the diversified liquidity pool.
- **BMX Freestyle**: An intent-based trading platform with a focus on low fees and offering over 250+ trading markets, powered by the SYMMIO protocol.
- **Based MediaX**: An onchain avatar (NFT) and veAERO marketplace on Base with a fee of 1.9%, where listings with multiple avatars use Chainlink VRF to distribute randomly to buyers.

**Morphex (MPX)** is the original deployment on Fantom, equivalent to BMX Classic.

Pricing for the protocol is determined by price feeds directly from Chainlink and [Pyth](https://pyth.network/) for the fastest and most accurate updates. As the protocol matures, governance will eventually decide most parameters.
