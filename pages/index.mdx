# Morphex Labs

**Morphex** is an emerging **decentralized exchange** offering **spot** and **perpetual futures** trading,
while requiring only a wallet connection to use. All trades are settled against the **Morphex Liquidity Pool** ("**MLP**"), where a user would be able to provide liquidity with any whitelisted asset, and in exchange, they would receive **MLP tokens**, representing their share in the diversified liquidity pool.

For traders, **Morphex** offers various advantages over existing exchanges:

- low transaction fees
- no price impact
- “scam wick” liquidation protection (while keeping full control of your assets)

Welcome to the new era of **DeFi perpetual trading**.

Pricing for the protocol is determined by price feeds directly from Chainlink and [Pyth](https://pyth.network/) for the fastest and most accurate updates. As the protocol matures, **governance** will eventually decide the majority of parameters (examples include liquidity incentives for a specific **MLP pool** in the future).
