# **Referrals**

## Overview

If you want to earn *rebates* and *discounts* on the **Morphex** trading platform, you can create a *referral code* and share it with your network. In this way, you can get **rewarded** for bringing new traders to the platform, and they can <u>save money</u> on their *trading fees*. The *referral program* has a **tier system** to reward **active and successful referrers**.

## Creating a referral code

To create a *referral code*, you need to follow these steps:

1.  Go to **[](https://www.morphex.trade/referrals)[https://www.morphex.trade/referrals](https://www.morphex.trade/referrals)**.
2.  Click on the *Affiliates* tab.
3.  Create a *referral code* using any combination of **letters**, **numbers**, and **underscores**.
4.  Note that *referral codes* are **case-sensitive**.

Once you have your *referral code*, you can copy the *referral link* and **share it** with others on social media, messaging apps, or any other platform you prefer. When someone clicks on your *referral link*, their account will be linked to your *referral code*, and you will start earning *rebates* whenever they trade.

## **Rebates and discounts**

The *rebates* and *discounts* offered through the *referral program* apply to the **opening** and **closing fees** for leverage trading on **Morphex**. The opening and closing fees are **0.1%** on Morphex, and there is **no price impact** for trades and **zero spread** for tokens like **BTC** and **ETH**. *Rebates* are calculated **before** user *discounts*, which means *referrers* earn on the **full maker fee**, and from what would otherwise be *spread* on other exchanges. You will receive *rebates* in **FTM**, and your *rebates history* will be viewable on the *referrals page*. Note that the *referral program* is **subject to change** as it is determined by the **token holders** of **MPX**.

## **Tiers**

The *referral program* has **three tiers**, which provide different levels of *discounts* and *rebates*:

- **Tier 1**: **5%** *discount* for traders, **5%** *rebates* to referrer.
- **Tier 2**: **10%** *discount* for traders, **10%** *rebates* to referrer.
- **Tier 3**: **10%** *discount* for traders, **15%** *rebates* to referrer paid in **FTM**, **5%** *rebates* *to* referrer paid in **esMPX**.

Anyone can create a **Tier 1** code, but to upgrade to **Tier 2** or **Tier 3**, you need to meet certain criteria:

- **Tier 2**: At least **15** *active users* using your *referral codes* *per week* and a *combined weekly volume* above **$5 million**.
- **Tier 3**: At least **30** *active users* using your *referral codes* *per week* and a *combined weekly volume* above *$25 million*.

If you fulfill these criteria, please contact the team in [Discord](https://discord.gg/TR7zzfT2ru) or [Telegram](https://t.me/MorphexFTM) to *upgrade your code*.

Note that there is a cap of **5000 esMPX** distributed *per week* for **Tier 3**, and the price of **esMPX** will be based on the *7-day TWAP* of **MPX**.
