# BMX on Mode

BMX has deployed on Mode, an exciting and rapidly growing L2 network built on Optimism Superchain. All mechanics are mostly the same as BMX on Base, with the liquidity token **MLT** composed of **ETH**, **Wrapped eETH**, **Wrapped BTC**, **MODE**, and **USDC**. The wrapped liquidity token, **wMLT**, has all the benefits expected from the Yearn-architectured wrapped liquidity vault token, **wBLT**. These include automatically compounding rewards, possible advantageous liquidity with other tokens in DEX pairs, and enhanced borrowing power due to the automatically compounding rewards, increasing its value over time, essentially self-repaying debt. 

### Bridge
BMX token supply is unchanged, and users can easily bridge from Base to Mode through Transporter, powered by Chainlink CCIP. Bridge BMX now with this pre-populated direct link: https://app.transporter.io/?from=base&tab=token&to=mode&token=BMX

### Summary
With everything in place, yield is as easy and familiar as it gets. 
Stay tuned for more as we continue building on Mode.
