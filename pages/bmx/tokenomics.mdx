## BMX Tokenomics & Distribution

### Changes

- As of May 8, 2024, oBMX emissions have ended per [BIP 1](https://snapshot.org/#/bmxonbase.eth/proposal/0x813c71f096d55ac7aa6aaf1f9bc6ad0bbdf549c5287b15138d9c08eac5a8a86e), with a total of 402.7K oBMX burned as of August 14, 2024.
- BMX from team and incentives multisig addresses have been burned, with a total of 179,688 BMX (bought back with treasury wBLT) burned as of June 15, 2024.
- Individual burns are reported in the [#burns channel on our Discord](https://discord.com/channels/892431105339306044/1208380197867622400).
- Approximate new total supply is estimated to be 2.85 million BMX (burns ongoing).

Total Supply: 2.85 million **BMX** (previously 10 million)

Incentives: 7,000,000 **BMX** as **oBMX** (70%) across ~35-months/3yrs.
- All incentives have been burned, there are no longer any emissions since May 08.

Treasury: 285k **BMX** (10%)
- Incentives have been separated from Treasury’s allocation, which cannot be used for  incentives. Treasury’s primary purpose is to support the protocol's expenses, scale the protocol, and increase protocol owned liquidity. Allocation could be used for capital rounds in the future with lock-up terms.
- Previously was 850k BMX before burns

Team: 370.5k **BMX** (13%)
- Scaled down to match original allocation % with new total supply after burns, was previously 1.3 million BMX

**MPX** Claimable Airdrop: 600,000 **BMX** as **oBMX** (6%)
- Each month for six-consecutive months, 100,000 oBMX will be distributed based on a snapshot taken at random during the month. Those holding MPX, MPX-FTM, MPX-BNB, and Morphex NFTs will be able to claim their share of 100k oBMX each claim period. A new snapshot is taken randomly sometime within the 30-day window which is not announced prior to or after it has been taken. The block used for the snapshot will be posted on the UI when that claim period goes live. Claim periods will last 30-days, any unclaimed oBMX after the claim period ends is forfeited. All unclaimed oBMX will be redistributed to Morphex NFT holders in a separate claims process; more details to be announced later. Team vesting addresses are excluded from this airdrop except for NFT positions as none were allocated to team; all if any were purchased. This airdrop amount represents approximately 24% of circulating supply after the sixth distribution occurs (excluding Treasury’s allocation).
- This is no longer active.

Initial Seed Liquidity: 250,000 **BMX** (2.5%) 
- Will be paired with $25k worth of wBLT to provide a $50k TVL wBLT-BMX native liquidity pool at launch. Launch FDV is approx. $1mm.
