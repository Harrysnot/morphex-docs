# Tokenomics

## Migration

The exchange rate of **PILLS** to MPX **will** be **1:1**. After swapping **PILLS** to **MPX**, **50%** of the **MPX** would be immediately available, with the **other 50%** vesting *linearly* over a period of **one year**. Users would be able to claim their vested tokens however often they’d like, and they would be able to visit a simple interface to facilitate this. The migration would be live for a specific period of time — voted on by **PILLS** holders.

**20%** of **MPX** would be reserved for the **PILLS** migration, with half of it being immediately available upon launch, and the other half vesting linearly over a year. **1%** of this would be used in an **airdrop** for early **PILLS** holders back in **April 2022** ([](https://github.com/0xidm/ms-reports/blob/main/pills-analysis.ipynb)[https://github.com/0xidm/ms-reports/blob/main/pills-analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/0xidm/ms-reports/blob/main/pills-analysis.ipynb)).

## Staking

**Staked MPX** will receive _three_ types of rewards:

- Escrowed **MPX**
- Multiplier Points
- **FTM** Rewards

For more info on **Escrowed MPX** and **Multiplier Points**, please see the **Rewards** section of the documentation.

**30%** of fees generated from trading are converted to **FTM** and distributed to staked **MPX tokens**.
Note that the *fees* distributed are based on the number after deducting referral rewards
and the network costs of keepers.

In order to stake your **MPX tokens** to begin earning rewards, head over to the **Earn** page
on the website.

## Supply

PIE CHART IMAGE GOES HERE

For the token supply of **MPX**, the maximum supply will be **50 million tokens**, with the following planned token distribution:

-   **20%** of **MPX** would be reserved for the **PILLS** migration, with half of it being immediately available upon launch, and the other half vesting linearly over a year.
-   **25%** to be used as protocol **liquidity incentives** in the form of an escrowed token reward (**esMPX**). The team will monitor and analyze the performance of incentives and balance accordingly, presenting all findings to the community.
-   **45%** to be allocated to the **Morphex Treasury**. This would be used for marketing incentives, partnerships, capital-raising rounds, to provide protocol-owned liquidity, and to compensate community contributors. Treasury expenses will be transparent and presented to the community.
-   **10%** to be allocated to the team, according to the same vesting schedule for **PILLS** holders — *linearly over one year*.
