## Migration

**INFO STILL TO BE FINALISED** <br />
We want to enable **tokenomics** that will allow for _growth_ in a highly competitive environment
while not diluting **PILLS holders** more than it _enables potential growth_.
Again, this will more or less be the suggestion that we will present later,
with all numbers being subject to **community sentiment** and _voted on in future polls_.
These are not final numbers.

We're working on implementing a **multiplier mechanism**, which would allow users _to farm_ **multiplier
points** leading up to the actual token swap allowing them to receive a bonus amount of the new token,
which _by default will be_ **1:1** for everyone. I won't delve more into the multiplier details at the moment,
as stated earlier, we've noticed some potential inefficiencies in terms of possible taxation
for this migration system.

Suggestion for new token distribution:

- 54% for **PILLS holders** (from the max supply of the new token)
- 17% to be used as **liquidity incentives**, in the form of a escrowed token reward (i.e. vested)
- 24% for **protocol treasury** (providing liquidity, marketing, partnerships, potential investors, community contributors, if required additional liquidity incentives)
- 5% linear distribution to the team over 2 years

**Liquidity incentives** replace the current idea of emissions we use with **PILLS**,
entire supply would be **pre-minted**. Should be adequate incentives for 2 years ideally.
**Treasury tokens** will always be held in a **multi-sig** (as they are now).
Essentially, the majority of the actual **circulating supply** will be for migratoooors at token launch.
All tokens will follow a **vesting period**, community will be able to decide the amount
of direct unlock + vesting period.

Community will decide on **keeping**, **increasing** or **decreasing** the following:

- % of new token **max supply** for PILLS holders
- % of **liquidity incentives**
- % of **treasury**
- % of **core team**
- % allocated for the **multiplier system** as a bonus during token swap (more details soon, as noted earlier)
- % of **multiplier points** to allocate to **PILLS holders** during April snapshot (same as above, more details soon)
- new token **vesting period** + direct **unlock amount**

## Staking

**Staked MPX** will receive _three types of rewards_:

- [x] Escrowed MPX
- [x] Multiplier Points
- [x] FTM Rewards

For more info on **Escrowed MPX** and **Multiplier Points**, please see the “Rewards” section of the documentation.

**30%** of fees generated from trading are converted to **FTM** and distributed to staked **MPX tokens**.
Note that the fees distributed are based on the number after deducting referral rewards
and the network costs of keepers.

In order to stake your **MPX tokens** to begin earning rewards, head over to the “Earn” page
on the website.
