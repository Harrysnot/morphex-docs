## What we usually consider as impossible are simply engineering problems… there’s no law of physics preventing them.” - Michio Kaku

BMX creates capital efficient, composable products.

Definitions:

Native-protocol token: BMX

Liquidity provided for traders to utilize: BLT (BMX Liquidity Token)

Wrapped, composable, multi-use, auto-fee-accruing version of BLT: wBLT

BMX stands for Base-MorpheX

Automated fee-processing: automatically depositing fees accrued back into the underlying token.

Summary

BMX enhances the PDLPs (Perp DEX Liquidity Pools) model. By wrapping BLT inside a Yearn-architected automated fee-processing vault (wBLT) and pairing it directly with BMX, the protocol eliminates the fight between trading liquidity and native token liquidity.

BMX improves capital efficiency for the protocol by eliminating competition between trading liquidity (BLT) and native-protocol liquidity (pool2), and supports increased protocol accrued fees through minting and redemption fees of wBLT, trading activity on intents-based Freestyle, as well as all NFT/onchain media activity on Based Media X.

The most significant innovation is the introduction of wBLT as a product with multiple use cases built on top of automated fee-processing of BLT.

Some of the use cases are as follows:
