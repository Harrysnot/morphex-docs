# Wrapped MLP

## Description

The **wMLP** vault is based on the latest Yearn vault architecture. It accepts *staked* **MLP** for deposits with a simple strategy, generating yield: deposit **MLP** into **Morphex** to earn **esMPX** + **FTM** and compound all **FTM** back into **MLP**. The **esMPX** rewards will be staked for **esMPX** + **FTM** + **Multiplier Points**, again sending the **FTM** yield to be further compounded into **MLP**, and staking the earned **esMPX** and **MP**s. The wrapper is *fully liquid* and users will be able to withdraw their principal **MLP** and any earned interest from the compounding of **FTM** at any time.

## Risks
While the USD price of **MLP** tends to be stable, it may drift away from **$1** for extended periods of time. See the [MLP page](https://docs.morphex.trade/mlp) of our documentation for more information.
