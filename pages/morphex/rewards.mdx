# Rewards

<img src="/images/rewards.png" alt="Rewards" />

## Compounding vs Claiming

There are two options for receiving **rewards** on the "Earn" page: "Compound" and "Claim".
When you choose "Compound", your pending **Multiplier Points** and future **Escrowed MPX** rewards _will be staked_, which will _increase the number of rewards **you** receive_. When you select "Claim", any **pending rewards** will be _transferred_ to your **wallet**.

If you choose to compound or stake your **Escrowed MPX** tokens, you can unstake them for vesting at any time in the future.

## Escrowed MPX

Escrowed MPX (**esMPX**) can be used in two ways once the token is launched:
- it can be staked for rewards similar to regular MPX tokens
- it can be vested to become actual MPX tokens over a period of one year

Each **staked esMPX token** will earn the same amount of **esMPX** and **FTM rewards** as a regular **MPX token**. It is important to note that **esMPX** is not meant to be transferable unless you are transferring your entire account. The amount of **MPX** or **MLP** required to vest **esMPX** is unique to each account and is capped at the rewards received by that account.

It is not recommended to **buy esMPX** on the market or through **OTC channels**,
as you will not be able to vest them.

## Vesting

The _process of converting_ **Escrowed MPX** (**esMPX**) tokens into **MPX tokens** is called **vesting**.
This can be done on the "Earn" page. When **vesting** is initiated, a certain number of
**MPX or MLP** tokens will be reserved. This number is determined by the average amount of
**MPX or MLP** tokens that were used to earn the **esMPX rewards**.

For example, if you _staked_ 1000 **MPX** and _earned_ 100 **esMPX** tokens, then to _vest_ 100 **esMPX** tokens, 1000 **MPX** tokens will be reserved. To vest 50 **esMPX**, 500 **MPX** tokens will be _reserved_.
Note that this is an example and the actual ratio depends on the _average staked amount_
and _rewards earned_ for your account.

While **esMPX tokens** that have been **unstaked** and _deposited_ for **vesting** will not earn rewards, staked tokens that are _reserved_ for **vesting** _will continue to earn rewards_. After initiating vesting, the **esMPX tokens** will be converted into **MPX** every second and will fully vest over **365 days**. **Vested esMPX tokens** that have been converted into **MPX** can be _claimed at any time_.

If you sell **MPX or MLP tokens** and want to _vest_ your **esMPX rewards** at a later time, you will need to _re-buy_ the **MPX or MLP** tokens. **MPX**, **esMPX**, and **Multiplier Points** _can all be used interchangeably_ for the required reserve amount. It is possible to deposit into the vesting vault while existing vesting is ongoing.

**Tokens** that are _reserved for vesting_ cannot be unstaked or sold. To unreserve the tokens, the user can use the "Withdraw" button on the "Earn" page. However, **partial withdrawals** _are not supported_, so withdrawing will withdraw and unreserve all of the tokens as well as pause vesting. Any **esMPX tokens** that had already been vested into **MPX** will remain as **MPX tokens**.

## Multiplier Points

**Multiplier Points** (**MP**s) are rewarded to _long-term holders_ of **MPX tokens** that do not increase the **overall supply** of MPX. When you **stake MPX**, you **earn MPs** at a fixed rate of **100**% APR. For example, if you stake 1000 **MPX** for one year, you will earn 1000 **MPs**.

You can earn more rewards by **staking MPs**. To do this, go to the "Earn" page and press the "Compound" button. Each **MP** _will boost_ the annual percentage rate (APR) of rewards at the same rate as a regular **MPX token**.

When you _unstake_ **MPX or esMPX tokens**, the corresponding amount of **MPs** will be burned. For example, if you have staked 1000 **MPX** and earned 500 **MP** so far, unstaking 300 **MPX** will burn 150 **MPs** `(300 / 1000 * 500)`. The burn will apply to all **MPs**, whether **staked** or **unstaked**. To transfer staked tokens without burning **MPs**, use the "Transfer" button on the "Earn" page.

The "Boost Percentage" shown on the "Earn" page shows the boost to your **FTM** APR from your **MPs**. For example, if the APR for **FTM rewards** is **10**% and you have **$10,000** worth of MPX and esMPX, your annual rewards would be $1000. If you also have an amount of MP equivalent to 20% of your total **MPX and esMPX**, your "Boost Percentage" would display as **20**% and you would receive an additional **$200** in **FTM rewards** per year. The Boost Percentage is calculated using the following formula:

```js
Boost Percentage = 100 * (Staked MPs) / (Staked MPX + Staked esMPX)

/* An example: */
100 * (4.5656) / (7.54 + 2.00) = 47.85%
Boost Percentage = 47.85%
```

## Distribution Rate

**Escrowed MPX tokens** _will be distributed_ to staked **MPX and MLP tokens** according to schedules set by **governance**. Rewards are distributed every second to staked tokens. The **reward rate** is evaluated monthly and may be subject to change (any such change would be announced at least **7 days** before implementation).

## Summary

Here is a **summary** of the rewards and mechanics:

- **MPX** tokens _earn_ **FTM**, **esMPX**, and **Multiplier Points** when staked
- **esMPX** tokens _earn_ **FTM**, **esMPX**, and **Multiplier Points** when staked
- **Multiplier Points** _boost_ **FTM** APRs when staked
- **MLP** tokens _earn_ **FTM**, and **esMPX** and are _automatically staked_ when minted
