# MLP 

<img src="/images/mlp.png" alt="MLP" />

The **Morphex Liquidity Pool** (“**MLP**”) consists of an index of assets used for **swaps** and **leveraged trading**. It can be _created_, or _minted_, using any index asset and can be _redeemed_, or _burnt_, to receive any index asset. The price for _minting_ or _redeeming_ **MLP** is determined by dividing the total value of assets in the index, including profits and losses from open positions, by the **supply of MLP**.

**Holders of MLP** _earn rewards_ in the form of _Escrowed **MPX**_ and a portion (**60%**) of _platform fees_ paid in **FTM**. It's important to note that the **fees** distributed to **MLP holders** are calculated after deducting referral rewards and network costs for keepers.

If **leverage traders** make a _loss_, then **MLP holders** _will make a profit_, as they are providing the liquidity for trading (this also works in reverse). _Past performance data_, _**MLP** price charts_, and _other statistics_ can be found on the analytics site.

## Minting and Redeeming

To **mint MLP**, you can visit the **Liquidity** tab to see a list of available **MLP** tokens, with the option to choose one with the **lowest fees** (found in the **Save on Fees** section), and then enter the amount you want to purchase (with ***Mint MLP*** selected). The fee for buying **MLP** will depend on the _balance of assets in the index_, with _lower fees_ for assets that the pool has less of (compared to their target weight).

Once you have purchased **MLP**, it will be **automatically staked** and you will **start earning**
**Escrowed MPX** and **FTM** rewards, which can be viewed on the “Earn” tab. To **redeem MLP**,
simply enter the amount you want to redeem on the **Liquidity** page with **Redeem MLP** selected.

## Rebalancing

The **fees** for _minting_/_redeeming_ **MLP** and **swaps** will depend on whether the action _increases_ or _decreases_ the balance of assets in the index. For example, if the **index** _has a large percentage of FTM_ and _a small percentage of USDC_, actions that increase the amount of FTM in the index will have a **high fee**, while actions that _decrease the amount of FTM_ will have a **low fee**. The token weights, or the proportion of each asset in the index, can be viewed on the Dashboard and _are adjusted_ to _help protect_ **MLP holders** based on the open positions of traders.

If the _prices of tokens are increasing_, _the price of_ **MLP** _will also increase_, even if many traders have **long positions** on the platform. However, if a large number of traders are **shorting** a particular asset, and a higher weight is given to stablecoins as a result, **MLP holders** will have a synthetic exposure to the asset being shorted. For example, if **FTM** is being shorted and its _price decreases_, the **price of MLP** _will also decrease_. If the **price of FTM** increases then the **price of MLP** will increase from the losses of the short positions.

## Risks

There are **risks** associated with interacting with any **smart contract** or **blockchain application**,
including the potential for _vulnerabilities_ in the smart contract code. Some risks include _smart contract risks_ and _counterparty risks_ (if traders make a profit, that comes from the **MLP** pool), as well as _bridged token risk_ (potential for de-pegging due to bridge security risks).
