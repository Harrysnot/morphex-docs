## Staking

**Staked MPX** receives _two_ types of rewards:

- Multiplier Points
- **FTM** Rewards

For more info on **Multiplier Points**, please see the **Rewards** section of the documentation.

**30%** of fees generated from trading are converted to **FTM** and distributed to staked **MPX tokens**.
Note that the _fees_ distributed are based on the number after deducting referral rewards
and the network costs of keepers.

In order to stake your **MPX tokens** to begin earning rewards, head over to the **Earn** page
on the website.

## Supply

For the token supply of **MPX**, the maximum supply will be **50 million tokens**, with the following planned token distribution:

- **20%** of **MPX** would be reserved for the **PILLS** migration, with half of it being immediately available upon launch, and the other half vesting linearly over a year.
- ~~**25%** to be used as protocol **liquidity incentives** in the form of an escrowed token reward (**esMPX**). The team will monitor and analyze the performance of incentives and balance accordingly, presenting all findings to the community.~~
- **45%** to be allocated to the **Morphex Treasury**. This would be used for marketing incentives, partnerships, capital-raising rounds, to provide protocol-owned liquidity, and to compensate community contributors. Treasury expenses will be transparent and presented to the community.
- **10%** to be allocated to the team, according to the same vesting schedule for **PILLS** holders — *linearly over one year*.

As of January 25, 2024, esMPX emissions have ended per [MIP 1](https://snapshot.org/#/morphexbmx.eth/proposal/0xea1a6f37beb80e318f878e943beb3ef4da4f3d31443765fcf5e536db8259761e).
