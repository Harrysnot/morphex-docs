# Distrubution Suggestion for new Token

Our initial distribution suggestion for the new token. We want to enable tokenomics that will allow for growth in a highly competitive environment while not diluting PILLS holders more than it enables potential growth. Again, this will more or less be the suggestion that we will present later, with all numbers being subject to community sentiment and voted on in future polls. These are not final numbers.

As noted in the previous community call, we're working on implementing a multiplier mechanism, which would allow users to farm multiplier points leading up to the actual token swap allowing them to receive a bonus amount of the new token, which by default will be 1:1 for everyone. I won't delve more into the multiplier details at the moment, as stated earlier, we've noticed some potential inefficiencies in terms of possible taxation for this migration system.

Suggestion for new token distribution:

- 54% for PILLS holders (from the max supply of the new token)
- 17% to be used as liquidity incentives, in the form of a escrowed token reward (i.e. vested)
- 24% for protocol treasury (providing liquidity, marketing, partnerships, potential investors, community contributors, if required additional liquidity incentives)
- 5% linear distribution to the team over 2 years

Liquidity incentives replace the current idea of emissions we use with PILLS, entire supply would be pre-minted. Should be adequate incentives for 2 years ideally. Treasury tokens will always be held in a multi-sig (as they are now). Essentially, the majority of the actual circulating supply will be for migratoooors at token launch. All tokens will follow a vesting period, community will be able to decide the amount of direct unlock + vesting period.

Community will decide on keeping, increasing or decreasing the following:

- % of new token max supply for PILLS holders
- % of liquidity incentives
- % of treasury
- % of core team
- % allocated for the multiplier system as a bonus during token swap (more details soon, as noted earlier)
- % of multiplier points to allocate to PILLS holders during April snapshot (same as above, more details soon)
- new token vesting period + direct unlock amount

Before someone goes complaining that they would be immediately diluted by a huge amount, please re-read the above again, and keep in mind that the entire supply would be pre-minted, there won't be minting new tokens (in some sense you could count out a large % of treasury from max supply that would circulate, as it would only hold/use tokens in favor of the protocol obviously). Community will also be able to decide at what rate to incentivize liquidity with, effectively deciding that "emission". Vesting mechanics also play a role in the circulating supply at and after token launch.
