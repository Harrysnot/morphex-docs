## Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato: The Future of Financial Education and Marketing is Analogous
GLP stands for GMX-Liquidity Pool (token), however the “token” is typically silent. This token functions as a receipt (token) to claim a share of the underlying assets within the liquidity pool. However, the token itself is not a liquidity pool - *it’s a token* - which is transferrable and represents claimable value on the underlying assets (e.g. wBTC, wETH, USDC, etc.) within the liquidity pool. Distinguishing between the liquidity pool itself and the token representing claim on the underlying assets within the liquidity pool is important to understanding how **BMX** improves capital efficiency for liquidity providers beyond what the traditional GMX model allows for, which will be discussed in more detail later.

We also understand education and marketing are incredibly important to scale. We intend to focus heavily on them, which is another reason we chose BLT as a naming convention. Who doesn’t love a **BLT**? There are numerous analogous marketing opportunities to draw from between a liquidity pool and a bacon-lettuce-tomato (BLT) sandwich, and we believe analogous references will function as educational supports toward improved understanding of the concepts and mechanics behind **BMX**.

For example, a **BLT** sandwich is similar to a liquidity pool in composition, as various assets are combined to form the sandwich. The same is true for a liquidity pool on **BMX**; it is formed by combining various bluechip assets like wETH, wBTC and USDC. Each individual asset can be measured by weight, which we express as a percentage of the total liquidity pool composition. Sounds a bit complicated to explain to someone less-or-unfamiliar with DeFi or liquidity pools in general, right? The same can be applied to a BLT sandwich. Here is an example of the power of analogous marketing: Imagine your favorite BLT sandwich on a plate in front of you. The bacon is still sizzling. The lettuce is crisp. The tomato is juicy. Wait! Before you eat it, let's weigh it. Place your BLT sandwich on a scale and imagine it weighed 1-pound. Next let’s separate all of the ingredients and weigh them separately. The Bacon weighed 0.30 pounds; we can say that Bacon makes up 30% of the total weight of the BLT sandwich. Lettuce weighed 0.10 pounds and makes up 10% of the BLT. Tomato weighed 0.10 pounds and makes up 10% of the BLT. Bread weighed 0.50 pounds and makes up 50% of the BLT. Together, all of the ingredients equal the total weight of the sandwich. The same measurements can be applied to assets in **BMX**’s *liquidity pool*. Assume the total weight of the **BMX liquidity pool** is 1. Each asset has its own weight within the pool: wETH weighs 0.40 or 40% of the **BMX liquidity pool**. wBTC weighs 0.10 or 10% of the **BLP**. USDC weighs 0.50 or 50% of the **BLP**. Alright, I’m following…but why should we know this?

It is important to understand the *weight* of each asset within the liquidity pool to draw inferences on levels of risk exposure. The same is true for a BLT sandwich. If your BLT weighed 1-pound and your bacon weighed 0.75 or 75% of the entire weight of the sandwich, that BLT sandwich is overexposed to unhealthy fats and likely presents an increased risk of heart attack compared to a more well-balanced BLT sandwich. But, not always. While the amount of an ingredient can increase or decrease your risk, so too can the quality of your ingredients. 

For example, in comparing the two BLT sandwiches above, if the heavier allocation of bacon (0.75-pounds) is high quality and lean while the BLT sandwich with less bacon (0.25-pound) is poor quality and extremely fatty, the risk exposure could be significantly higher in the latter due to the poor quality and fattiness despite there being less bacon overall. The same line of questioning can be applied to assets within a liquidity pool. For example, having 50% of the liquidity pool as stablecoins could seem imbalanced, however, it is generally intentional, to reduce risk of volatility in the *liquidity pool token* (**BLT**) and provide traders adequate liquidity for short-positions. However, stablecoins are not always stable nor are they always of high quality! To asses quality within assets, a few factors to consider are the asset’s issuer, total value locked, total token holders, percent of tokens held by any one wallet, bridge reliances, backing, etc. Asset weight and asset quality are only two factors of many to consider when analyzing a liquidity pool and continued discussion around these topics is needed in the market.

**BMX** believes analogous marketing will support users’ knowledge and understanding of how decentralized perpetual trading platforms function and the dynamics of liquidity assets. Information is power and helping spread and share information in easily digestible formats is our focus. BMX looks forward to onboarding the next generation of DeFi users and in supporting migration of CEX users to on-chain. Are you hungry yet? What’s on the menu? Two items: BLT or wrapped-BLT.
## What is a wrapped-BLT? 
A wrapped-BLT is when you replace bread with a tortilla and wrap the bacon, lettuce, and tomato. It provides a different experience, generally less carbs and leaves you feeling lighter. Bread or tortilla, the choice is yours! At **BMX**, wrapped-BLT (**wBLT**) is an **ERC-4626** token received in response to depositing **BLT** into **BMX**’s native *Yearn-architectured*, auto-compounding reward vault. **wBLT** functions as a receipt token representing a claim on the underlying **BLT** within the vault. 

How it works: **BLT** earns **60%** of protocol revenue streamed in **wETH** as well as **15%** of native token emissions streamed in **oBMX** (more on **oBMX**, later). When a user deposits **BLT** and receives **wBLT**, the vault manages these rewards for the user. The vault strategy *harvests* all rewards and converts proceeds into **BLT** tokens, then deposits them into the vault, increasing the total amount of **BLT** tokens within the vault in excess of user deposit amounts. **wBLT** is fully liquid, so users are able to withdraw their principal **BLT** and earned rewards from the compounding strategy at any time. By depositing into the vault, **wBLT** holders are able to auto-compound BLT-rewards removing the need to self-claim and exercise **oBMX** themselves. Auto-compounding is merely one benefit and use case that BMX has defined for **wBLT**. The power of **wBLT** is understood when you consider all of the use cases, which **Morphex** has been defining and building over the past year. Before we begin defining them, let’s quickly review the history of how **Morphex** created **wBLT**. 

## History of Morphex’s Implementation of Native Yearn-Architectured Vaults

**Morphex** on **Fantom** launched **wMLP** (same as **wBLT**) vault live on 05/01/23 which continues to operate today without issue, currently with *greater than* **$500k TVL**. At time of writing, **Morphex** on **Fantom** remains the *largest perpetual trading platform* on **Fantom** by TVL size and margin trading volume. **wMLP** vault was designed by **Morphex** and developed in collaboration with a native **Yearn Finance** core contributor, who is now also a core contributor for **BMX** by **Morphex**. Additionally, **Morphex** on **Fantom** was the first protocol to collateralize GLP-equivalent liquidity via a vault token when it listed **wMLP** on a Fantom-native money market, which allowed users to borrow bluechip assets against **wMLP** with conservative loan-to-value ratios scaling from 20% to 60% over a few months. *Borrowing wMLP itself was intentionally disabled due to the inherent risk that would present. 

Morphex launched **wMLP-USDC** as a liquidity-paired asset on **Fantom-Velocimeter** (**FVM**) as an experiment in utilizing the vault token as a liquidity paired asset. **wMLP-USDC** continues to operate today without issue, currently with greater than **$35k TVL**. The vault strategy continues to convert **FTM** rewards into **MLP**, which increases the amount of **MLP** each **wMLP** can claim. Additionally, users who paired their **wMLP** with an equivalent amount of **USDC** and provided **wMLP-USDC** on **FVM Exchange**, have been able to earn additional **wMLP-USDC** rewards from **FVM** in addition to vault rewards.

**Morphex** on **Fantom** proved the concept that perpetual trading liquidity can be both collateralized and utilized as a liquidity-paired asset, to increase capital efficiency. **BMX** by **Morphex** builds on these innovations through additional improvements in protocol design and capital efficiency for reward distribution and tokenomics, to create and introduce capital-efficient perpetual trading liquidity as a product: **wBLT**!

## wBLT as a Product
**wBLT** has many use-cases which are built on top of #1. Here are a few:
1. Auto-compounds underlying BLT asset rewards removing need to self-claim/exercise
2. Can be collateralized to allow for borrowing of bluechip assets, while continuing to auto-compound earned rewards, which has the ability to decrease collateral ratio over-time, functioning as a unique/hybrid type of self-repaying loan.
3. Paired as native BMX liquidity: wBLT-BMX continues to earn auto-compounding wBLT rewards (which represent 60% protocol revenue and 15% native oBMX emissions) in addition to: 30% protocol revenue streamed direct to LP gauge on Base-Velocimeter as wETH, 60% native oBMX emissions, 60% of option-revenue (more on this later), and 100% of oBVM (option-Base-Velocimeter) directed to wBLT-BMX gauge from veBVM voters.
4. Can be paired as a liquidity asset with other-tokens, providing multiple benefits:
    - Instead of pairing wETH-(native token), a protocol can deposit their wETH into BMX, obtain wBLT, earn their share of auto-compounding rewards and pair wBLT with their native asset to provide native protocol liquidity. This allows the protocol and their liquidity providers to earn their share of 60% BMX protocol revenue and 15% oBMX emissions as BLT, in addition to their native rewards.
    - By pairing with wBLT, a protocol is effectively pairing with an index of bluechip assets (wETH, wBTC, USDC) reducing risk of single-asset price impact on their native token liquidity. Huge potential here for L2 chains such as Fantom.
    - When the value of wBLT increases this translates to positive price impact on the token it is paired with which is the same mechanism that allows wBLT to decrease collateral ratio overtime.
    - Generates additional trading revenue on the pair as wBLT can be arbed. Also, as it is arbed, mint and redeem fees may occur generating increased BMX protocol revenue, thus increasing auto-compounding rewards for wBLT.

## BMX Tokenomics & Distribution

Total Supply: 10,000,000 **BMX**

Incentives: 7,000,000 **BMX** as **oBMX** (70%) across ~35-months/3yrs.
- All incentives are distributed as option-BMX tokens. 50k **oBMX** per week, static amount.

Treasury: 850,000 **BMX** (8.5%)
- Incentives have been separated from Treasury’s allocation, which cannot be used for  incentives. Treasury’s primary purpose is to support the protocol's expenses, scale the protocol, and increase protocol owned liquidity. Allocation could be used for capital rounds in the future with lock-up terms. 

Team: 1,300,000 **BMX** (13%)
- Distributed linearly over 1.5 years. 

**MPX** Claimable Airdrop: 600,000 **BMX** as **oBMX** (6%)
- Each month for six-consecutive months, 100,000 oBMX will be distributed based on a snapshot taken at random during the month. Those holding MPX, MPX-FTM, MPX-BNB, and Morphex NFTs will be able to claim their share of 100k oBMX each claim period. A new snapshot is taken randomly sometime within the 30-day window which is not announced prior to or after it has been taken. The block used for the snapshot will be posted on the UI when that claim period goes live. Claim periods will last 30-days, any unclaimed oBMX after the claim period ends is forfeited. All unclaimed oBMX will be redistributed to Morphex NFT holders in a separate claims process; more details to be announced later. Team vesting addresses are excluded from this airdrop except for NFT positions as none were allocated to team; all if any were purchased. This airdrop amount represents approximately 24% of circulating supply after the sixth distribution occurs (excluding Treasury’s allocation). 

Initial Seed Liquidity: 250,000 **BMX** (2.5%) 
- Will be paired with $25k worth of wBLT to provide a $50k TVL wBLT-BMX native liquidity pool at launch. It is important to note slippage will be high. Launch FDV will be approx. $1mm.

## BMX Protocol Revenue

**60%** to **BLT** (streamed as wETH; auto-compounded into BLT if staked in wBLT)  
**30%** to **wBLT-BMX** LPers (direct to LP gauge streamed as wETH)  
**10%** to Treasury

## Native Incentives Distribution: oBMX
*50k oBMX per week for ~35 months*

**15%** to **BLT**  
**60%** to **wBLT-BMX**  
**25%** as bribes for **wBLT-BMX** LP on **Base Velocimeter** (**BVM**)

## **oBMX** Exercise Options
* **wBLT** is the payment token for all **oBMX** option exercises, however for user convenience we’ve built a contract to: accept any underlying BLT asset (wETH, wBTC, USDC, DAI), mint **wBLT**, then exercise.
* Option exercise price is based on a two-hour, time-weighted average price (2-hour TWAP). 

#### Option 1:
- Discount for liquid **BMX** = **12%**
- Payment in **wBLT** token

#### Option 2:
- Min **wBLT-BMX** LP discount = **25%**
- Lock duration for min LP discount =10 days 
- Payment in wBLT token 

 (Durations between 10-days and 60-days optional, populates a scaled discount)

- Max wBLT-BMX LP discount = **65%**
- Lock duration for max LP discount = 60 days
- Payment in **wBLT** token

When exercising Option 1 oBMX to BMX with the above discount, an exerciser would receive a 12% discount from the market price of BMX based on a two-hour time-weighted average price (2-hour TWAP).

When exercising oBMX to wBLT-BMX for the minimum locked-LP duration of 10 days, an exerciser would receive a 25% discount from the market price of BMX based on a two-hour time-weighted average price (2-hour TWAP).
## oBMX Option-Revenue

- **60%** streamed as **wBLT** to **wBLT-BMX** LPs which will be claimable from the gauge on **Base-Velocimeter**  
- **25%** streamed as **wBLT** which will be redeemed then used to buy-back **BMX** on market, mint **oBMX**, then distribute as additional bribes on **Base-Velocimeter**  
- **15%** streamed as **wBLT** to Treasury

## Flowchart of BLT and wBLT Incentives Distribution

*Reminder: **25%** of **oBMX** incentives are directed as bribes to the **wBLT-BMX** gauge each week on **Base-Velocimeter Exchange** (**BVM**).

## Chainlink and Pyth: Price Feeds, Contract Automation, and CCIP Integration
**Morphex** and **Chainlink** have worked closely together over the last two months examining how **Chainlink** can support and improve **Morphex**’s operations on all chains. As a result, we are excited to announce that **Morphex** has signed contracts with **Chainlink** for price feed integrations for **Morphex** on **Fantom** and **BMX** by **Morphex** on **BASE**. For both **Fantom** and **BASE** operations, **Morphex** will utilize **Chainlink Automation** to further decentralize infrastructure, including contract actions for keepers, revenue distribution, and more. Lastly, **BMX** token will utilize **Chainlink CCIP** to grant **BMX** the ability to move cross-chain should the need arise! **Morphex** and **Chainlink**’s collaboration is mutually supportive and as such, stay tuned for more information from **Chainlink** directly to learn more about **Morphex**’s integrations!

Similar to our Fantom and BNB Chain deployments, pricing for the protocol is determined by price feeds directly from both Chainlink and Pyth for the fastest and most accurate updates. Fast price updates are provided by a Pyth pricing service which our keepers then submit on-chain. Chainlink prices are used for liquidations as well as ensuring the Pyth prices are within an acceptable range for added security.

## Summary
**BMX** by **Morphex** innovates upon the generic GMX model by removing escrowed tokens and single-staking entirely. Through our innovative design model, BMX allows access of the underlying liquidity that forms **BLT**, our GLP equivalent. This is done through our native yearn-architectured, auto-compounding vault token, wBLT. Additionally, we have paired **wBLT** with our native-protocol token, **BMX**, to form our native liquidity pair (**wBLT-BMX**) without the need for a wETH or second native liquidity pair.

**BMX** by **Morphex** improves capital efficiency for the protocol by eliminating competition between trading liquidity (**BLT**) and native-protocol liquidity (pool2), supports increased protocol revenue through minting and redemption fees of wBLT for option-exercises and arbitrage opportunities. BMX improves capital efficiency for liquidity providers who co-support trading liquidity and native protocol liquidity (**wBLT-BMX**) as **90%** of protocol revenue and other native and external incentives are earned. 

The most significant innovation is the introduction of **wBLT** as a product with multiple use cases all built on top of auto-compounding **BLT** rewards: **wBLT-BMX** native protocol liquidity, ability to be paired with other assets (wBLT-(other asset)) which benefits protocols through **wBLT**’s auto-compounding rewards in addition to the underlying **BLT** assets being an index of blue-chip assets, can be collateralized to allow users to continue to earn auto-compounding rewards while borrowing against their **wBLT** position (never allowed to borrow wBLT itself), is used as an option-payment token to exercise oBMX and can be used in the future as a payment option for other use-cases such as another protocols option-tokens payment, for protocol salary streams, or other products/services.

**Morphex** is a collective of contributors who are anonymous to one another and live all across the world, contributing to the success of **Morphex** alongside a *powerful community*. **Morphex** believes in decentralization, self-custody, and on-chain actions, and never has access to or holds user funds. At the time of writing, **Morphex** is the *largest perpetual trading platform* on **Fantom** by TVL and margin trading volume, with nearly **$500mm total volume** since inception. **Morphex** launched only a few months ago on **BNB Chain** and has done nearly **$65mm total volume**. We look forward to showcasing **BMX** by **Morphex** on **BASE** alongside continued support for **Morphex** on **Fantom** and **BNB Chain**, as plans for each are to work towards transitioning from their current models towards **BMX** by **Morphex**’s model.

We look forward to the future and from all of us at **Morphex**, thank you for taking the time to learn more about **BMX** by **Morphex** and **wBLT** as a product. If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please feel free to reach out in **Discord** or on **X** (formerly Twitter).
