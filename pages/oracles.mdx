## Chainlink and Pyth: Price Feeds, Contract Automation, and CCIP Integration
**Morphex** and **Chainlink** have worked closely together over the last two months examining how **Chainlink** can support and improve **Morphex**’s operations on all chains. As a result, we are excited to announce that **Morphex** has signed contracts with **Chainlink** for price feed integrations for **Morphex** on **Fantom** and **BMX** by **Morphex** on **BASE**. For both **Fantom** and **BASE** operations, **Morphex** will utilize **Chainlink Automation** to further decentralize infrastructure, including contract actions for keepers, revenue distribution, and more. Lastly, **BMX** token will utilize **Chainlink CCIP** to grant **BMX** the ability to move cross-chain should the need arise! **Morphex** and **Chainlink**’s collaboration is mutually supportive and as such, stay tuned for more information from **Chainlink** directly to learn more about **Morphex**’s integrations!

Similar to our Fantom and BNB Chain deployments, pricing for the protocol is determined by price feeds directly from both Chainlink and Pyth for the fastest and most accurate updates. Fast price updates are provided by a Pyth pricing service which our keepers then submit on-chain. Chainlink prices are used for liquidations as well as ensuring the Pyth prices are within an acceptable range for added security.
