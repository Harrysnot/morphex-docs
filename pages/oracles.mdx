# Oracles

Pricing for the protocol is determined by price feeds directly from both Chainlink on-chain and Pyth off-chain for the fastest and most accurate updates. Fast price updates are provided by a Pyth pricing service which our keepers then submit on-chain. Chainlink prices are used for liquidations as well as ensuring the Pyth prices are within an acceptable range for added security, acting as a fallback oracle if required.
