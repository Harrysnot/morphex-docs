# Morphies

## Description

**Morphies** are a collection of *2,500* hand-drawn avatars, uniquely created by NFT artists **REPEATR** and **Tombheads**. **Morphies** are powerful, evolutionary fragments of the blockchain in both their art form and utility. With their arrival, they bring exciting changes to the tokenomics of Morphex on BNB Chain.

## Mint price: 0.5 BNB

- *70%* will be paired with the equivalent **MPX** from Treasury to form **MPX-BNB LP** tokens to increase **POL** and deepen native liquidity.
- Treasury will *burn* an equivalent amount of **MPX** in correlation to what is matched to create this LP.
- Example: If Treasury provides 300k **MPX** to pair with 136 **BNB**, an additional 300k MPX **will** be *burned*.
- This position will be held in a separate **Morphies** multi-sig.
- *30%* will be sent to Treasury for protocol development, expenses, and incentives.

## Each minted NFT will

- Represent the voting power of 1000 **MPX** for future governance
- *Burn* 1000 **MPX** from total supply via protocol treasury

## Each staked NFT will

- *Earn* rewards based on weight within the staking pool from the **MPX-BNB LP** within the **Morphies** multi-sig.
- All rewards from this position will be *streamed* to staked NFTs.

With these features, a full mint at the current prices would result in approximately 4.43mm **MPX** *burned*, an *estimated* 9% decrease in the total supply of **MPX**.

## Tokenomics Change (BNB Chain)

With the arrival of **Morphies**, **Morphex** looks to *strengthen* tokenomics to deepen **MPX-BNB** liquidity. Bolstering our native liquidity is a *top priority* for **Morphex** and increasing the amount of rewards for LPs is necessary to scale liquidity.

## BNB Chain Revenue Distribution Change

- 60% to MLP — **NO CHANGE**
- 20% to MPX/esMPX (single staking) — **Redirection of 10%**
- 10% to bribes for MPX-BNB LP on partner DEXs — ***NEW***
- 10% to protocol treasury — **NO CHANGE**

**_This change does not apply to Fantom network operations or tokenomics._**

Deeper native liquidity *helps* the protocol immensely by *affording* buyers less slippage, *reducing* sellers’ price impact, *stabilizing* **MPX** incentive APRs, and *strengthening* the stability of **MPX** during market volatility. With this change, Morphex **will** be able to better *support* the **MPX-BNB** liquidity providers that provide the stability required for a *healthy* DeFi protocol.
