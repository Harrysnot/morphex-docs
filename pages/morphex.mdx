**Morphex** is a **decentralized exchange** offering **spot** and **perpetual futures** trading,
requiring only a wallet connection to use. All trades are settled against a singular liquidity pool consisting of blue-chip assets, where a user can provide liquidity with any whitelisted asset, and in exchange, they receive LP tokens, representing their share in the diversified liquidity pool.

For traders, **Morphex** offers various advantages over existing exchanges:

- low transaction fees
- no price impact
- “scam wick” liquidation protection (while keeping full control of your assets)

Welcome to the new era of **DeFi perpetual trading**.

Pricing for the protocol is determined by price feeds directly from Chainlink and [Pyth](https://pyth.network/) for the fastest and most accurate updates. As the protocol matures, governance will eventually decide most parameters.
