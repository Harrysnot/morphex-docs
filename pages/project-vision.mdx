# Project Vision

Our mission is to bring the best perpetual trading experience to DeFi users while providing the highest capital efficiency for liquidity providers.

**All** trades, in the beginning, will be facilitated through a **singular** liquidity pool that consists of multiple **whitelisted assets** with different weights. In the future, this will be **expanded** to allow for multiple liquidity pools with tokens of different categories (for example blue-chip assets, stablecoins, interest bearing tokens, etc.). This then allows for the opportunity to introduce **voting mechanics** for directing **incentives** between the various pools, all using the platform’s governance token, **$MPX**.

Required protocol keepers and liquidator bots will be gradually fully decentralized, utilizing proven tools such as **Chainlink Automation**.

To complement the protocol’s core offering, other products would be launched that would build on top of the existing model, such as an *auto-compounding* wrapper for **MLP**. This wrapper, or wMLP, opens the doors to new yield opportunities by being able to collateralize your market-making liquidity or stake it in farms for further rewards.

Our vision for **Morphex**’s development also includes optimizing the **mobile experience** for DeFi perpetual platforms, and growing not only real yield, but real partnerships with other protocols.
