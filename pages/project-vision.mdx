# Project Vision

Our mission is to fully utilize the Fantom network’s *highly* optimized blockchain technology to bring the best perpetual trading experience to DeFi users

**All** trades, in the beginning, will be facilitated through a **singular** liquidity pool that consists of multiple **whitelisted assets** with different weights. In the future, this will be **expanded** to allow for multiple liquidity pools with tokens of different categories (for example blue-chip assets, stablecoins, interest bearing tokens, etc.). This then allows for the opportunity to introduce **voting mechanics** for directing **incentives** between the various pools, all using the platform’s governance token, **$MPX**.

Required protocol keepers and liquidator bots will be gradually fully decentralized, utilizing proven tools such as **Chainlink Automation**.

To complement the protocol’s core offering, other products would be launched that would build on top of the existing model, such as a delta-neutral vault for **MLP** with risk-on and risk-off options that would integrate not only with **Morphex**, but with other **Fantom protocols** to provide users the *highest* yields.

Our vision for **Morphex**’s development also includes optimizing the **mobile experience** for DeFi perpetual platforms, developing **Morphex** in line with the Fantom Foundation’s roadmap, and growing not only real yield, but real partnerships with other protocols.
