# Project Vision

<img src="/images/Our_vision.png" alt="Our Vision" />

Our mission is to fully utilize the Fantom network’s *highly* optimized blockchain technology, and now including Binance Smart Chain, to bring the best perpetual trading experience to DeFi users

**All** trades, in the beginning, will be facilitated through a **singular** liquidity pool that consists of multiple **whitelisted assets** with different weights. In the future, this will be **expanded** to allow for multiple liquidity pools with tokens of different categories (for example blue-chip assets, stablecoins, interest bearing tokens, etc.). This then allows for the opportunity to introduce **voting mechanics** for directing **incentives** between the various pools, all using the platform’s governance token, **$MPX**.

Required protocol keepers and liquidator bots will be gradually fully decentralized, utilizing proven tools such as **Chainlink Automation**.

To complement the protocol’s core offering, other products would be launched that would build on top of the existing model, such as a *delta-neutral* vault for **MLP** with *risk-on* and *risk-off* options that would integrate not only with **Morphex**, but with other **Fantom and Binance Smart Chain protocols** to provide users the *highest* yields.

Our vision for **Morphex**’s development also includes optimizing the **mobile experience** for DeFi perpetual platforms, developing **Morphex** in line with the Fantom Foundation’s roadmap, and growing not only real yield, but real partnerships with other protocols.

As we have now expanded operations to Binance Smart Chain, we will maintain both Fantom and Binance Smart Chain deployments constantly as we always have for all of our products.
