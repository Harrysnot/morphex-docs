`All trades`, in the beginning, will be facilitated through a **singular liquidity pool** that consists of
multiple whitelisted assets with different weights, and in the future,
_will be expanded_ to allow for **multiple liquidity pools** with tokens of different categories
(for example **blue-chip assets**, **stablecoins**, **interest bearing tokens**, etc.).
This then allows for the opportunity to introduce voting mechanics for directing incentives
between the various pools, all using the _platform’s governance token_, **$MPX**.

Required protocol keeper and liquidator bots will be gradually fully decentralized,
utilising proven tools such as **Chainlink Automation**.

To complement the protocol’s core offering, other products would be launched that would build
on top of the existing model, such as **delta-neutral strategies** for the **MLPs**,
as well as tying in the existing **mLQDR wrapper for xLQDR** to be able to provide additional utility
for our platform, such as trading **discounts/rebates**.
