# Trading Competitions

## Format

**Margin trading competitions will be recurring and held weekly** (not just a one-off event). Each competition will **begin on a Wednesday at 00:00 UTC** and end **on the next Wednesday at 00:00 UTC**, with reward/rebate distributions happening after the **previous week’s competition has finished**.

-   All traders can view their statistics on the **Leaderboard** page of the website: [](https://www.morphex.trade/leaderboard)[https://www.morphex.trade/leaderboard](https://www.morphex.trade/leaderboard).
-   All trades must be performed on the **Morphex** platform through the interface: [](https://www.morphex.trade/)[https://www.morphex.trade/](https://www.morphex.trade/)
-   The core contributors <u>reserve the right</u> to further review and potentially disqualify any contestants if deemed to not be in good faith of the competition or malicious.

**Any user** can take part in these competitions, and trades opened/closed on **Morphex** within the competition’s date range (each week, beginning from Wednesday) **will be eligible for prizes**.

### **Morphex trading competitions will consist of 3 different prize categories:**

-   **Volume rewards**: To qualify, a minimum volume of **$10,000** must be generated over the week.  Once the **esMPX** is distributed, it can **only be staked for rewards** (**esMPX** + **FTM**/**BNB** + **MPs**). Volume is calculated as the position size when closing your position.
-   **Top 3 percentage profits for a single trade (or ROI in %):** To be eligible, the collateral for the given trade must be **at least $100.**
-   **Top 3 cumulative percentage profits over the competition period:** Cumulative percentage profits are defined as the *sum of your trade percentage PnLs*. As an example, if you were to close your first trade with a percentage PnL of 50% and close your second with a percentage PnL of -20%, your cumulative percentage profits would be 30%. **Only trades opened with a collateral value of at least $100 will be eligible.**

Percentage profits are defined as **`(profit) / (collateral) * 100%`**. The collateral value used will be the highest collateral recorded from opening the position to closing.

As the *[Rewards](https://docs.morphex.trade/rewards)* page describes, rewards and activities such as trading competitions on Fantom and Binance Smart Chain are **isolated** to their respective chains. 

*For current prizes, please view our interface.*
