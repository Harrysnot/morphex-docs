# Wrapped MLP

## Description

The **wMLP** vault is based on the latest Yearn vault architecture. It accepts *staked* **MLP** for deposits with a simple strategy, generating yield: deposit **MLP** into **Morphex** to earn **esMPX** + **FTM** and compound all **FTM** back into **MLP**. The **esMPX** rewards will be staked for **esMPX** + **FTM** + **Multiplier Points**, again sending the **FTM** yield to be further compounded into **MLP**, and staking the earned **esMPX** and **MP**s. The wrapper is *fully liquid* and users will be able to withdraw their principal **MLP** and any earned interest from the compounding of **FTM** at any time. **wMLP** can also be used as collateral on **Scream**.

## New Collateral

The vault receipt tokens of the **MLP** vault, **wMLP**, is whitelisted on Scream to be used as interest-bearing collateral, and is exclusive to **Morphex**’s MLP. An *external oracle* pulls the price of **MLP** from the **MlpManager** contract, and factors in the increasing exchange rate of **MLP** to **wMLP**. This price is then used to determine its collateral price on **Scream**.

## Benefits

By allowing users to utilize **MLP** as collateral, they are able to unlock greater *capital efficiency* on their assets, allowing them to earn auto-compounding yield and borrow against it. To cover the cost of develop and maintenance, and to add another revenue stream to help repay **Scream**’s v1 bad debt, a *7.5% performance fee* will be taken on every harvest, accumulating as *wMLP* in the Scream treasury.

## Risks
While the USD price of **MLP** tends to be stable, it may drift away from **$1** for extended periods of time. See the [MLP page](https://docs.morphex.trade/mlp) of our documentation for more information. Understand that there may be risks not only in the multiple layers of smart contracts involved, but also in the borrowing of assets against a supplied collateral. It is generally recommended for all users of borrowing platforms to regularly and closely monitor their *health factor*. This determines the point at which a user may get liquidated. The health factor considers the state of a user's borrowing and lending, which involves the prices of the assets being supplied and borrowed. If healther factor reaches 1, the user is at risk of liquidation. Lastly, understand that Scream is a external platform and is different from Morphex.
