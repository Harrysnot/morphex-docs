# Official Morphex Documentation

**Morphex** is an emerging **decentralized exchange** offering **spot** and **perpetual futures** trading, while requiring only a wallet connection to use. All trades are settled against the **Morphex Liquidity Pool** ("**MLP**"), where a user would be able to provide **liquidity** with any whitelisted asset, and in exchange, they would receive **MLP tokens**, representing their share in the diversified liquidity pool.
