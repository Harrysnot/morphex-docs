# **Referrals**

## **How it works**

To create a referral code:
-   Go to _link_
-   Click on the *Affiliates* tab
-   Create a referral code using any combination of letters, numbers, and underscores
-   Note that referral codes are case-sensitive

Once you've created your code, click on the copy icon next to the code to get your referral link, it should look something like this: _link_. You can share this link on any platform, e.g. Twitter, Discord, or Telegram. When a user clicks on your link, your referral code would be stored with the user's account. When the user makes a trade they would receive a discount and you would earn rebates from their trading fees. You will continue to earn rebates even if the user uses another device later on as the referral code is stored on the contract the first time the user makes a trade.

The discounts and rebates will be distributed as **FTM** every Wednesday, your rebates history will be viewable on the referrals page.

Note that the referral program is subject to change as it is determined by the token holders of **MPX**. Full referral terms may be viewed here: _link_.

## **Tiers**

The referral program has a tier system to prevent gaming through self-referrals, this helps to ensure that referrers receive the rebates for the users they brought onto the platform.

- **Tier 1**: **5%** discount for traders, **5%** rebates to referrer
- **Tier 2**: **10%** discount for traders, **10%** rebates to referrer
- **Tier 3**: **10%** discount for traders, **15%** rebates to referrer paid in **FTM**, **5%** rebates to referrer paid in **esMPX**

Anyone can create a Tier 1 code. To upgrade your code to Tier 2 or Tier 3:
- **Tier 2**: At least **15** active users using your referral codes per week and a combined weekly volume above **$5 million**
- **Tier 3**: At least **30** active users using your referral codes per week and a combined weekly volume above $**25 million**

If your account fulfills these criteria, please submit the application form at _link_. After filling in the form please send a message to _link_ so that we can follow up.

Rebates and discounts apply on the opening and closing fees for leverage trading. The opening and closing fees are **0.1%** on **MPX**, there is no price impact for trades and zero spread for tokens like **BTC** and **ETH**, and rebates are calculated before user discounts so referrers earn on the full maker fee and from what would otherwise be spread on other exchanges. As a result, referrers would earn equivalent amounts of rebates per volume on **MPX** when compared to other referral programs.

Note that there is a cap of **5000** **esMPX** distributed per week. If the price of **MPX** is **$30** the full **5%** bonus can be paid for total **Tier 3** referral volumes of up to **$3 billion** per week. **esMPX** tokens distributed for this program will not require MPX or MLP to vest, the vault to vest the tokens will be available towards the end of **Q1 2023**. The price of **esMPX** will be based on the **7-day** **TWAP** of **MPX**.
